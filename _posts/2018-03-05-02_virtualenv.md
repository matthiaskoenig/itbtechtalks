Virtual environments in python.
* Allows to manage and distribute all required project dependencies easily with a given projects.
* Simple use with pycharm and other IDEs

## python & pip
Make sure that python and pip are installed. 
```
python --version
pip --version
```


## virtualenv & virtualenvwrapper

`virtualenv` is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.
`virtualenvwrapper` simplifies working with virtual environments.

### Create virtual environment
In a first step we create a new virtual environment
```
mkvirtualenv itbtechtalks -python=python3 -
```

### List all virtualenvs
```
lsvirtualenv
```


### List the dependencies
```
(itbtechtalks) pip list | less
(itbtechtalks) lssitepackages
```

### Install dependencies
```
(itbtechtalks) pip install matplotlib
```


### Delete virtual environment


## requirements.txt
To list the requirements of a given project these are normally listed in a `requirements.txt` in a project which can easily be installed via
```
(myenv) pip install -r requirements.txt
```
