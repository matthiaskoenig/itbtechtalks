Jupyter notebooks

## Setup
The notebook can be easily installed via pip. The notebook uses a kernel to execute the commands.

```
workon itbtechtalks
(itbtechtalks) pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The necessary pip packages for the notebook are
```
(itbtechtalks) pip install jupyter jupyterlab
```

In addition we install our virtualenv as a kernel for the notebook
```
(itbtechtalks) ipython kernel install --user --name=itbtechtalks
```

## Starting the notebook
The jupyter notebook can than be started with
```
jupyter notebook
```

## Notebook features
Via the lorenz example the main features of the Jupyter notebook are demonstrated:

- file navigation
- kernels (kernel seclection)
- cell types (markdown, code, ...)
- markdown syntax (writing documentation)
- images, links, latex
- creating reports
- upload to github and browse


## Jupyter lab
An alternative frontend is the jupyter lab which provides very similar functionality but with many additional features.
```
jupyter lab
```
